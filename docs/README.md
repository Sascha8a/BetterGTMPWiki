# "Better" GT-MP Wiki. Work im progress.

By actively engaging with server owners and community leaders we try to understand what they would like to see changed, implemented or removed. Only by actively interacting with the community we can truly work to tailoring the client to the needs of our players. We advise you to constantly provide us with constructive feedback to improve Grand Theft Multiplayer. We are as excited as you are in finally moving to the point where we can build a good foundation for custom, online dedicated servers in Grand Theft Auto V. Remember to report any bugs you might have to our [Bug Tracker](https://bug.gt-mp.net/my_view_page.php)!
